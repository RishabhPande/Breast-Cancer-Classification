# Breast-Cancer-Classification

Building machine learning models to improve accuracy of diagnosis and predicting if the cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant based on several observations/features as shown below:

* radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
* texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
* perimeter
* area
* smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
* compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
* concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
* concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
* symmetry
* fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
